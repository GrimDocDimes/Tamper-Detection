# Tamper-Detection
This project aims to develop a tamper-proof weighing scale system using the ESP32 microcontroller to ensure transparency, accuracy, and security in trade measurements. The system detects any form of tampering or unauthorized access and immediately reports it through a real-time monitoring dashboard.
